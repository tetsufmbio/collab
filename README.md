# collab

This repository is a collection of scripts devoloped by me (Tetsu Sakamoto) in collaboration with other research groups. 

You are free to use and modify them. 

Run the script in the command line to see the instructions to use it. To run the script, just type:

> perl <script_name.pl>

Some pertinent information (description, dependencies, etc.) are described in the top of each script.  

Some scripts have Perl modules dependencies (also listed in the beginning of the scripts). To install a Perl module, please follow the instructions in http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html.

If one of these scripts was useful in your work, please cite this repository and, if applicable, the work that inspired its development.
